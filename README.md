# Turing-Machine

This project was done as fulfilment of project of Theory of Computation course.

The repository contains the source code of Turing Machine.

The team members were:

1. Dhruva Agarwal

2. Biren Sharma

3. Ajinkya Bedekar

The code does the following tasks:

1. Input two Base Four numbers with sufficient spaces between the two numbers

2. The two Base Four numbers are first converted into decimal numbers

3. Decimal addition is performed between the converted numbers

4. The sum is finally converted into a Base Four number
